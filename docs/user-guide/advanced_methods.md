# Advanced methods

The [basic training procedure](training_new_operators.md) presented earlier
may achieve acceptable performance in easy problems, but it is not sufficient
when dealing with more challenging tasks. TRIOSlib also offers more sofisticated
methods to deal with these cases. 

The next sections provide a summary of what each method does, a simple code
example and a recommendation of when to use it. All methods also provide a link
to a scientific article describing them in full detail.
